Hello! I am a full stack web developer. I have worked extensively in PHP, JavaScript and recently in Ruby on Rails. 

This is my personal blog. Here I write about programming.

This blog ([repo](https://github.com/splendidexponent/splendidexponent.github.io)) is generated using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). I'm using the [minima theme](https://github.com/jekyll/minima/tree/2.5-stable) with very slight modification. The only other tool I'm using, [built](https://github.com/jekyll/minima/tree/2.5-stable#enabling-comments-via-disqus) into minima, is [Disqus](https://disqus.com/) comments.
