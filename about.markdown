Hello! I am a full stack web developer. I have worked extensively in PHP, JavaScript and recently in Ruby on Rails. 

This is my personal blog. Here I write about things I learn in programming.

This blog is generated using Jekyll and hosted on GitHub Pages. I'm using the minima theme with very slight modifications.
