title:  "Git CLI and GitHub Desktop"
---

I used `git-cli` for a very long time. I switched to [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) and like it.

In `git-cli`, to see detailed commit history, I used `gitk` GUI. It came bundled with `git`. With GitHub Desktop everything is in one GUI application.

With GitHub desktop, SSH keys are not needed. It uses GitHub oAuth to login and sets up GitHub Desktop as a GitHub application.

For repositories cloned in GitHub Desktop, remotes are setup as `https` urls.

For running advanced Git commands, not part of the regular workflow, there is *open in command prompt* option.

Also, worth mentioning about [Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/). Another Git GUI for [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/product).

### Tip

If you are using VSCode editor and need path to `git` executable, you can use GitHub Desktop bundled `git`.

```json
{
    "git.path": "C:\\Users\\YOU\\AppData\\Local\\GitHubDesktop\\app-3.2.6\\resources\\app\\git\\cmd\\git.exe"
}
```
